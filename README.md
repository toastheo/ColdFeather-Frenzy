# ColdFeather-Frenzy

## About the Game

- Brief Description: A simple mini-game in which the main objective is to sort chickens into the right enclosures while under increasing time pressure
- Genre: Casual Puzzle Game
- Platform: Windows, MacOS, Web (play on itch.io: https://realtheo.itch.io/coldfeather-frenzy-alpha)

## Gameplay

The game is usually played with a mouse and keyboard. The mechanics are relatively self-explanatory. The chickens must be dragged and dropped into the corresponding colored enclosures. 
The trick here is that more and more chickens appear over time and you only have a limited amount of time to assign them correctly.
(Note: The game can also be played on mobile devices via the website, but is not optimized for this.)

## Build Requirements

### Unity Version

This project was developed using Unity version 2022.3.12f1. To ensure compatibility, please use this version or newer. You can download it from the [unity website](https://unity.com/de/download "Unity Download Page").

### External Dependencies

The game uses 2 different asset packs:
The Chickenpack asset is subject to the royality-free license and can therefore be integrated directly into the project.
The download link can be found [here](https://vmiinv.itch.io/chickenpack-asset "Chicken Pack Asset").

The Cozy Farm Asset Pack, on the other hand, prohibits any resale of the assets. For this reason, the asset pack must be purchased independently. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the [Build Instructions](#build-instructions).
